Introductions

Hi everyone and thank you for joining us for the first-ever Data Carpentry workshop at University of Nevada, Reno. We are excited for this workshop, but we also have a lot to cover. Bear with us and we will try to have you leave with a set of skills that can be applied to your data.

### Here are your instructors for the workshop:
![Elias](https://whiteheadresearch.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/elias1-e1504896758344.png) 
* __Elias Oziolor__ - Postdoctoral Fellow at UC Davis
    * Elias spent his dissertation time exploring the mechanism of adaptation which allows _F. grandis_ to adapt to heavy contamination
    * Currently he is working on developing computational tools for analyzing time-series population genomic data to understand the effects of population collapse in Pacific herring (_Clupea pallasii_), as well as assisting with the transcriptomic assessment of responses of herring to early developmental co-exposure of oil and viral challenge.

* __Sateesh Peri__ - PhD Candidate at UNR
    * Sateesh spends his time creating custom computational pipelines to analize differential expression to understand the role of Long non-coding RNA in spermatogenesis.
